# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Julia and I'm a self-taught data scientist. I'm especially interested in the intersection of data science :bar_chart: and sustainability :earth_africa:. 

On my GitHub profile, I share some of my projects which include building a portfolio website :computer:, doing time series forecasting for bike sharing data :bike:, and completing the CS50 course by HarvardX :woman_student:. I also write :memo: :pencil: for Towards Data Science and share ideas, tutorials, and deep dives on ML models.
